# Enigma Self-Evaluation

1. Functionality

   I would give myself a 3 on functionality. The encrypt and decrypt methods both work, and the command line interface also functions as specified in the rubric.
   

2. Object Oriented Programming

   I would give myself a 3 on object oriented programming. I have four classes, and each one (key, offset, shift, and enigma) takes care of a very specific function for the project. No class is longer than 100 lines long, and I have reviewed my methods to make sure that their names are as concise but accurate as possible. 
   
   
3. Test Driven Development 

   I would give myself a 4 on test driven development. I have reviewed all of the test names to make sure that they properly communicate which method or attribute they are testing. Every method has a test. I had to use a stub to pass the key randomization generator in the key class. Also, the SimpleCov coverage is at 100%. 
   
   
4. Version Control 

   I would give myself a 3 on version control. I have over 120 commits and over 10 pull requests. Although some commits may include multiple tests/methods, I made sure to commit quite frequently so that each one includes a specific function of the project.
